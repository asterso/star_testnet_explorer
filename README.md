# star_testnet_explorer
Blockchain explorer for STAR Social &amp; Enterprise Chain testnet based on blockscout and a tool for inspecting and analyzing the blockchain.

# About BlockScout
BlockScout is an Elixir application that allows users to search transactions, view accounts and balances, and verify smart contracts on the Ethereum network including all forks and sidechains.

Currently available full-featured block explorers (Etherscan, Etherchain, Blockchair) are closed systems which are not independently verifiable. As Ethereum sidechains continue to proliferate in both private and public settings, transparent, open-source tools are needed to analyze and validate transactions.
